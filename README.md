## `Hi there, welcome to my GitHub!`
I'm Ray Lam, a Full Stack Web Developer with 6+ years of experience, specializing in PHP web development. My passion is writing clean, scalable code, particularly with modern MVC frameworks like Laravel. I've had the pleasure of working with amazing clients like China Mobile and Swire Properties, helping them create innovative solutions that enhance user experiences.

Currently, I’m a Full Stack Developer at LiveBuzz, where I build online registration forms and ensure smooth, user-friendly interactions for over 200 live websites. I’m always eager to learn new things and love mentoring junior developers to help them grow in their careers.

Here on GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects showcasing my skills in PHP, JavaScript, React.js, and more. I’ve also included a testing playground that highlights my focus on quality assurance and test-driven development. I take pride in crafting dynamic web applications that offer seamless functionality with great user experiences across different platforms.

I have been passionate about coding since I joined Codewars in February 2016. With a current rank of 4 kyu and over 1,111 honor points, I've completed 272 kata, showcasing my commitment to honing my skills. I enjoy solving a variety of challenges and puzzles that push my programming abilities to new heights.

Before the rise of AI in coding, I dedicated significant time to tackling kata on Codewars, which helped me develop a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithm design. I appreciate the community aspect of Codewars and the opportunity to learn from others while contributing my own solutions. 

Feel free to explore, and thanks for stopping by!
